# Malware

This is a repository to just post and store the malware development I'm doing and learning.

## XOR Encryption (Malware)
Encrypts a .bin (payload) file and decrypts it in memory before executing it.

Usage
```
.\Malware.exe '[KEY]' [file.bin]
```

## RemoteInjector
Reads the payload (in 64 bits format) from a .bin file and injects it into a remote running process. The payload is XOR encrypted before being injected and later on decrypted in memory.

This approach allows you to bypass defender (When file is downloaded from an external server)

Usage
```
# Local .bin file
.\RemoteInjector.exe [Local] [payload file] [Process PID] [XOR Encoding Key]

# Remote .bin file -> Modify the IP & .bin file from source code
.\RemoteInjector.exe [Remote] [anything] [Process PID] [XOR Encoding Key]
```
