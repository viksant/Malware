# Malware

This is a repository to just post and store the malware development I'm doing and learning.

## XOR Encryption (Malware)
Encrypts a .bin (payload) file and decrypts it in memory before executing it.

Usage
```
.\Malware.exe '<KEY>' <file.bin>
```

## RemoteInjector
Reads the payload (in 64 bits format) from a .bin file and injects it into a remote running process. 

Usage
```
.\RemoteInjector.exe <file.bin> <Process_PID>
```
